### Introduction
Given historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), we can build a model that predicts whether a borrower will pay back their loan. This would be useful to decide whether a future customer would be able to pay back the loan based on their conditions

### Our Goal
This study uses a subset of the LendingClub DataSet obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club
